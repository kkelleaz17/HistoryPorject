      <h1>D-Day</h1>
      <h2>D-Day was the largest sea assault which was led by 
        The Allied Forces on June 6th, 1944 which was during World War II. 
        This whole operation main objective was to get into Europe which was commanded by Germany so 
        The Allied Forces wanted to get an area in Europe. There were approximately 156,000 soldiers 
        from the US, Great Britain, Canada and other Allied Countries  who all landed near the coast of 
        France.
        Europe was very fortified by the NaziÂ´s which is why this is known as the largest sea assault. Even with all these obstacles the Allied Forces were able to establish a base on the coast of France. This would mean that the Allied Forces have ways to get to Germany now with a plan rather than just leading a full platoon of people into Europe and not having a base.
