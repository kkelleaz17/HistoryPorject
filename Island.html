        <h1>Island Hopping</h1>
        <h2>Island hopping was the United States strategy to gain and cover land in World War II.
             This strategy was very costly for the Japanese and the United States, 
             some key battles include the battles of Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. 
            Most of the battles were the United States trying to capture Islands and push forward.
            Total defense was a strategy deployed by the Japanese, this strategy was only making the islands stronger and harder to capture, this was deployed because the Japanese knew that the islands would be almost impossible to recapture from the United States but they couldnâ€™t just let the United states creep up close to their mainland.
            Overall, Island hopping caused the United States to claim victory over Japan because Japan surrendered due to the bombings but more importantly the only way we could reach without being taken down was because of the Island Hopping strategy used to get close to the mainland.
