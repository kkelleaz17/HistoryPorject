        <h1>Pearl Harbor</h1>
        <h2>The attack on Pearl Harbor was when the Japanese attacked 
            the harbor to try and stop the US from interfering. 

            This attack instead caused the opposite reaction and lit a fuse within the US causing them to fully engage in the war and specifically with Japan. At first the US wasn't going to interfere with the War but they were forced to because they couldn't just get attacked and not do anything about it.

            The attack occurred on December 7th, 1941 and the harbor was located in Hawaii. 
            The attack was an aerial attack where Japan bombed the entire harbor.
        </h2>
        <ul class="ListStyles">
            <li>1,178 US Citizens wounded</li>
            <li>2,403 Us Citizens dead</li>
            <li>300 Us aircrafts destroyed</li>
            <li>8 US warships destroyed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The attack on Pearl Harbor left the US with many 
            losses and it even caused an outburst between the US citizens because of these losses. Japan thought of the US as a threat because they thought the US would take supplies from them and not include them because of past events where the US would leave them out. This attack also had an effect on the Japanese people living in the US as they were sent to camps because the US thought they could plan an attack from within.
            In the end this was a great turning point in the war as the US went from being Isolated to joining the war with full engagement.
        </h2>


        <h1>Axis Powers</h1>
        <h2>A little bit after this declaration of attack on Japan, Germany and Italy decided to attack the US because Japan, Germany, and Italy had similar goals. They all wanted to try and take over their respective areas and expand slowly to take over the world and have everyone under their control. The group was called The Axis Powers which included Japan, Germany, and Italy.
        </h2>
        <h1>Allied Forces</h1>
        <h2>The Allied Forces were created as a way to counteract the Axis Powers including Great Britain, France, Soviet Union,  The US, and China. They shared a similar goal to get rid of the Axis Powers and stop them from taking over the world.
