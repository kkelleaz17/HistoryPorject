    <h1>Then Vs Now</h1>
    <h2>
      Japan and America's relationship was not very good during the time of WW2. 
      They had a ton of problems from past events. Japan was worried that The US would leave them out 
      because The US had done the same thing before. That is why Japan then proceeded to attack Pearl 
      Harbor which only worsened their relationship with the US since the US decided to retaliate after
       this attack which Japan didn't expect. Japan was worried that the US would start taking supplies 
       from Asia which would impact Japan since they wouldn't have enough resources for themselves. 
       The US also started putting Japanese Americans in camps because they thought they would do an 
       inside operation. This whole mishap caused a ton of problems between the US and Japan which is why their
        relationship was worsening. Now Japan and the US have a good relationship where they constantly
         keep up with arrangements and the citizens also visit so Japanese people come to the US and the
          American people go to Japan. They also share similar goals now and similar values.
